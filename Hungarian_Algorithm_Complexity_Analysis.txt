Hungarian Algorithm – Complexity Analysis for Delivery Optimization

Time Complexity
O(n³)

- n = number of agents or tasks (assumes a square cost matrix).
- The algorithm performs multiple passes over the matrix for reduction, zero covering, and adjustment.
- Efficient for moderate-sized assignment problems.

Space Complexity
O(n²)

- Requires storage for the cost matrix and marker matrices for assignments and zero coverage.

Notes:
- Ideal for static delivery assignment problems where all costs are known in advance.
- Can be extended to dynamic delivery models by updating the cost matrix in real time.
- Guarantees optimal assignment – making it suitable for high-priority delivery optimization like drones, where efficiency is critical.
- Compared to metaheuristic approaches (e.g., Cuckoo Search), it ensures deterministic optimality rather than relying on exploration or random search.
